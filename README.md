# WhatsAlysis
### Analyse and visualise your WhatsApp chats

</div>

----

## What is this?

This tool helps you to visualise your conversation history with a specific person or of a group. Currently, it can visualise:

- Number of messages by each person
- Mostly used words
- Active time period
- Group subject names

## How to use?

**Step 1**: Exporting the chat from WhatsApp
 - Go to the chat which you want to analyse
 - Go to the kebab menu on the top right corner
 - Go to **`More`**
 - Select **`Export chat`**
 - Select **`WITHOUT MEDIA`**
 - Save the chat export somewhere

**Step 2**: Using WhatsAlytics to analyse
 - Go to [Whatsalysis](https://waal.vercel.app/)
 - Click/tap on **`Choose file`** and select the exported chat
 - Done!

## Why?

I don't know where I was going with this. It came out to be a good exercise on Regular expressions and I learnt a great deal about performance when dealing with large arrays. This is the reason you'll find functional as well as procedural implementations in the codebase. 

Also, I wanted to use [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev) somewhere which by the way, is a major upgrade from CRA.

## Local development

- Clone
- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`
